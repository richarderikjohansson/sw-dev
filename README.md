# Software Development for Researchers

GitHub repository for the course in software development for researchers.
This course is optional for Ph.D. students at the Swedish Institute of Space
Physics and Lule√• University of Technology and is worth 7.5 credits.

## Homeworks
Solution to exercises can be seen in *scripts* directory, but I check out 
the [documentation](https://richarderikjohansson.github.io/sw-dev/) for full
solutions and thought process under *Homeworks*

## Group work
Two larger group tasks were handed to us where the first one was to create 
a numerical integrator with a cli interface. The second one was to create 
a chatroom application. Down below is the forks of the repositories.
