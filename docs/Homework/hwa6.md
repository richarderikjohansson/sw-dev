# Testing

Made a fairly simple calculator that only handle integers. I can see how 
making these types of tests could be beneficial in some cases when you maybe 
scale the software and want to ensure that no bugs will be introduced.

When it comes to the case for this homework I think it helped me to 
understand how I wanted the software to work. Meaning it helped me to 
design the software.

I have also tried to configure my moonlander so it works well with the 
new keyboard layout I am using. I switched to DVORAK in order to combat 
my issues with my joint in my index finger. However it takes some time 
to get used to it, especially in nvim since I have so much muscle memory 
built in when it comes to vim movement.

I also did this switch since I never learned touch typing. I always cheated 
when using QWERTY, and I seem to do better with DVORAK. But I am still very 
slow.
