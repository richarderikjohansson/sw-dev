# Collaboration

Looked through some of the material that was shared in the handout. I also attended a course
at CodeRefinery that Johan Kero recommended. It was more of a workshop than a course and during 
the first week we focused on everything *Git*. The second week we focused on good practices 
to achieve reproducible research. Overall a very good course/workshop.
