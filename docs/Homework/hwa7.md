# Styles of development

This is one of the homework assignments I did not put to much effort in, 
unfortunately. This is due to other pressing, and time sensitive matters
that I had to focus on. However, I did something at least and wrote a very
simple calculator which can be seen in the `calculator` module.
I mainly did this because I wanted to try out the `unittest` package. So 
this exercise is poorly done from my side, but as mentioned, I had other 
matters to attend during this.
